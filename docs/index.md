# Interactive structural visualizations of complete mapping of mutations to the RBD that reduce binding by polyclonal sera from individuals infected with the B.1.351 variant of concern

Below are links to interactive visualizations of the effects of single mutations to the B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) on binding by plasmas from B.1.351 convalescent individuals.

These visualizations are built using [dms-view](https://dms-view.github.io/docs/).
These experiments are described in **add link**, and raw data are available [here](https://github.com/jbloomlab/SARS-CoV-2-RBD_B.1.351/blob/main/results/supp_data/B1351_raw_data.csv).
Plasmas from individuals infected with the B.1.351 (Beta) variant were first described in [Cele, et al. (2021)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03471-w).

The escape maps for plasmas from individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 in early 2020 were first described in [Greaney et al. (2021a)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312821000822). These convalescent plasma samples were first described in [Crawford et al. (2020)](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/223/2/197/5916372).

Sites where mutations reduce binding are shown for each serum, and are mapped to the ACE2-bound Wuhan-Hu-1 RBD structure ([PDB 6M0J](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6M0J)) or to the RBD of the B.1.351 variant ([PDB 7LYQ](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/7LYQ)).

Interactive visualizations of the escape maps:

 - B.1.351 convalescent plasmas mapped to the <a href="" target="_blank">ACE2-bound B.1.351 RBD</a> (made by aligning 6M0J and 7LYQ)
 - Early 2020 convalescent plasmas mapped to the <a href="" target="_blank">ACE2-bound Wuhan-Hu-1 RBD</a>
